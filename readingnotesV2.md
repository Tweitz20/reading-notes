# This is my example page for my codefellows reading notes

## I've learned quite a bit so far and know this isn't going to be easy :)

### the keys to success ive learned so far is to not give up even when it seems impossible, i know this course/schooling wont be easy and to take it a step at a time and dont be afraid to ask for help.

# **Dont Give Up**
###### ***Learning markdown seems pretty straight forward but if you get stuck on things google will be your best friend***
### *Calling a friend or asking for help is alot better then guessing and not putting you full effort forward.*
