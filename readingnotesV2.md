# This is my example page for my codefellows reading notes

## I've learned quite a bit so far and know this isn't going to be easy :)

### the keys to success ive learned so far is to not give up even when it seems imppossible, i know this course/schooling wont be easy and to take it a step at a time and dont be afraid to ask for help.

# **Dont Give Up**
